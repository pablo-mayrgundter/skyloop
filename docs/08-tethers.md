# Tether Systems  
  
This document describes the tethers that connect Skyloop tube sections and platforms to ground anchors and lower-altitude supports.  
  
## Purpose  
- Provide lateral and vertical stability for buoyant tube segments exposed to stratospheric winds.  
- Transfer loads from the floating structure to ground or lower platforms.  
- Enable controlled elevation and retrieval during installation and maintenance.  
  
## Configuration  
- **Vertical tethers:** Extend downward from stratospheric platforms to anchors on the ground or to intermediate drones/airships. These define the vertical position of the tube.  
- **Catenary tethers:** Span diagonally between tube segments and ground anchors to limit lateral displacement and oscillation.  
- **Dynamic tensioners:** Winches and reels integrated at nodes to adjust tether length and tension in response to changing weather and thermal expansion.  
  
## Materials  
- High-strength, low-density fibers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) or aramid.  
- Redundant strands to ensure safety in case of damage.  
- Sheathing to protect against UV, ozone and temperature extremes at high altitude.  
  
## Deployment & Operations  
- Tethers are deployed during section lift, gradually paying out as the tube rises.  
- Automated control systems monitor tension and adjust winches to maintain alignment.  
- In case of severe weather, tethers can reel in sections to safer altitudes or ground them temporarily.  
  
## Scalability  
- Early R&D uses lightweight cords on meter-scale prototypes to study dynamic behavior.  
- Demonstrator corridors will test full-scale tether systems with anchored buoys at 30 km spacing.
