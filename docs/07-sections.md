# Tube Sections  
  
This document describes the modular tube sections for the Skyloop system.  
  
## Design Rationale  
- The global Skyloop network is composed of discrete tube spans connected at nodes.  
- Each span is a buoyant stratospheric module between 20 and 50 km long.  
- Sections allow manageable assembly, maintenance and upgrades.  
  
## Structural Features  
- **Composite vacuum shell:** Thin-walled carbon-fiber composite to support partial vacuum at high altitude.  
- **Lift cells:** Hydrogen/helium toroidal balloons integrated around each section to provide buoyancy.  
- **Segment joints:** Flexible couplings with alignment guides and gimbals to accommodate slight motion and thermal expansion.  
- **Service conduits:** Embedded power lines, control cables and sensors running along the exterior.  
  
## Installation & Maintenance  
- Sections are assembled on the ground and floated to altitude using lift cells and tethers.  
- Joints lock into place at stratospheric nodes.  
- Modular design allows a damaged span to be detached and replaced without shutting down the whole network.  
  
## Scale Progression  
- R&D prototypes use 1 m, 10 m and 100 m sections in the lab and test range.  
- Commercial cargo corridors will adopt 20–50 km spans anchored by stratospheric platforms every 30 km.
