This document analyzes the cost structure and throughput potential of the Skyloop system.

## Baseline

Commercial air travel today costs $0.10–0.15 per passenger-mile to operate and carries tens of thousands of passengers per day on busy routes. The Skyloop aims to reduce costs by an order of magnitude and increase capacity by an order of magnitude.

## Cost Model

- **CapEx per km**: The buoyant tube and lift cells are expected to cost $5–10M per km. Station nodes range from $30M for minor nodes to $2–4B for major hubs. Pods cost $0.3–1.2M each but are reusable.

- **Operating cost**:
  - **Energy**: The near-vacuum environment results in extremely low drag; energy consumption is on the order of 0.5–2 Wh per passenger‑km, costing pennies per thousand miles.
  - **Maintenance**: Continuous drone-based inspection and replacement of lift cells, pods and station equipment yields an estimated $0.002–0.004 per passenger-mile.
  - **Operations**: Automated operations and minimal staff lead to $0.001–0.003 per passenger-mile.
  - **CapEx amortization**: Spreading infrastructure costs over decades and high usage results in $0.005–0.01 per passenger-mile.

Together, these factors yield an estimated total cost of $0.008–0.015 per passenger-mile—roughly one tenth of current air travel.

## Capacity

With pods carrying 2–4 passengers and spaced every 0.5–1 km within a corridor at speeds up to Mach 4:

- Pod frequency: ~4,000 pods per hour per direction.
- Passengers per hour: ~12,000 per direction.
- Passengers per day per corridor: 300k–500k.

This throughput exceeds the busiest airline corridors by an order of magnitude.
