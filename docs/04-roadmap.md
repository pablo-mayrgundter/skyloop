# Roadmap (Cargo-First)

This document outlines a cargo-first deployment plan for the Skyloop project.

## Phase 0 – Research & Development
- Conduct feasibility studies for buoyant vacuum tubes and dart-like cargo pods.
- Develop prototype pods and tube segments optimized for cargo payloads, including loading and unloading mechanisms.
- Work with regulators to define certification pathways for unmanned high-altitude cargo transport.

## Phase 1 – Demonstrator Segment (Cargo)
- Build a 10‑50 km test segment anchored near an aerospace facility to carry unmanned cargo pods.
- Demonstrate safe launch, travel, and recovery of cargo payloads with buoyant lift cells and vacuum integrity.
- Validate energy recovery, maintenance procedures and reliability at operational speeds.

## Phase 2 – Commercial Cargo Route
- Deploy the first operational cargo corridor between two logistics hubs (e.g., Los Angeles–San Francisco or New York–Chicago).
- Operate high-frequency cargo pods carrying high-value, time-sensitive goods, integrating with existing supply chains.
- Refine automated loading/unloading, vertical access at hubs, and optimize throughput and unit economics.

## Phase 3 – Extended Cargo Network & Passenger Trials
- Expand the cargo network across multiple city pairs, including transcontinental corridors.
- Begin limited passenger trials using modified pods once safety is thoroughly demonstrated in cargo operations.
- Adapt station and tube designs to support both cargo pods and early passenger capsules.

## Phase 4 – Global Network
- Construct transoceanic segments to connect major continents for cargo transport, gradually introducing passenger service.
- Scale manufacturing of pods and tube segments while building out global maintenance and logistics operations.
- Collaborate with international regulators to establish standards for stratospheric cargo and passenger transport.

## Phase 5 – Continuous Improvement & Autonomous Operation
- Transition to fully autonomous cargo and passenger operations with minimal human oversight.
- Enhance pod designs, improve energy efficiency and increase throughput.
- Explore new business models and integration with urban logistics networks as the system matures.
