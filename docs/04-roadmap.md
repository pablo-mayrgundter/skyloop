# Roadmap

This document outlines the phased deployment plan for the Skyloop project.

## Phase 0: Research & Development

- Establish research partnerships with universities and aerospace companies.
- Develop materials and buoyancy prototypes.
- Simulate stratospheric tube dynamics and pod performance.

## Phase 1: Demonstrator Segment

- Build a 10–50 km prototype tube segment anchored near an existing aerospace facility.
- Test buoyant lift cells, vacuum integrity and launch/recovery mechanisms.
- Validate pod performance at Mach 2.

## Phase 2: First Commercial Route

- Deploy a regional corridor (e.g., Los Angeles–San Francisco) with stations every 30 km.
- Certify the system with regulatory authorities.
- Begin limited passenger operations with commuter pods.

## Phase 3: Intercontinental Expansion

- Construct a long-haul corridor linking New York and London, with mid-ocean support platforms.
- Introduce Mach 4 intercontinental pods.
- Scale station infrastructure for high throughput.

## Phase 4: Global Network

- Extend corridors to connect major global cities such as Tokyo, Dubai, Paris and Singapore.
- Integrate with existing transportation networks for seamless first/last mile access.
- Expand cargo variants for rapid logistics.

## Phase 5: Autonomous Cargo & Continuous Improvement

- Deploy dedicated cargo pods and unmanned operations.
- Refine materials, energy recovery and service models.
- Work towards fully autonomous maintenance and operations across the network.
