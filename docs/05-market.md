# Market Analysis for Cargo-First Phases

This document summarizes potential cargo markets for the early phases of Skyloop's deployment, focusing on high-value, time-critical goods that benefit from rapid intercity transport.

## Phase 1 – Demonstrator Segment Markets

During the initial 10–50 km demonstrator, the system should target niche markets with high value density and sensitivity to delay:

- **Semiconductor wafers and photomasks:** Fab-to-fab transfers for chip manufacturing, where each shipment can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and delays can halt production lines.
- **Biomedical samples and genomic payloads:** CAR-T cells, genetic sequencing samples, and other lab specimens that require precise temperature control and minimal transit time.
- **High-value e-commerce:** Luxury goods, electronics, and fashion items moving between micro‑fulfillment nodes across a metropolitan region.
- **Defense R&D payloads:** Secure transport of sensors, prototype electronics and radiation test chips for government and aerospace contractors.
- **Pharmaceutical cold-chain:** Fragile biologics and vaccines that must move quickly between research facilities and hospitals.

These cargo types will help validate the system’s reliability, vibration control and temperature management while generating premium revenue.

## Phase 2 – First Commercial Corridor Markets

Once a full corridor between two cities (e.g., Los Angeles–San Francisco or New York–Chicago) is operational, the service can expand to larger-volume, high-value cargo flows:

- **Same‑day intercity e-commerce:** Guaranteed same-day delivery of high-value consumer goods across major city pairs.
- **Port-to-inland fast transshipment:** Moving priority containers or palletized cargo from seaports to inland logistics hubs within minutes, alleviating port congestion.
- **Automotive supply chains:** Just‑in‑time delivery of battery modules, power electronics and rare components to EV manufacturing plants.
- **Aerospace manufacturing:** Rapid movement of composite structures, engines and flight computers between suppliers and assembly lines to minimize downtime.
- **High-value perishables:** Premium seafood, produce and flowers where freshness translates directly into revenue.
- **Secure data shuttles:** Physical transport of crypto keys, cold-storage drives and other secure data carriers as the most secure link between financial hubs.

By focusing on these cargo categories, Skyloop can build a strong business case for cargo-first operations, demonstrating unmatched speed and reliability before expanding to passenger services.
