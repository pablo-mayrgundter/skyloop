# Architecture  

This document describes the engineering and operations of the Skyloop system.  

## Route and Network Topology  

- **Backbone corridors**: Connect major cities (e.g., Tokyo–LA–NY–London) using continuous sky-tube segments in the lower stratosphere.  
- **Node spacing**: Stations are placed every 20–50 km, acting as catapult launch/catch points and maintenance hubs.  
- **Modular expansion**: Additional corridors and feeder lines can be added as demand grows.  

## Tube Structure  

- **Materials**: Ultra‑thin composite shells designed to withstand a pressure differential of 5–50 kPa.  
- **Buoyancy**: Integrated hydrogen or helium lift cells provide partial lift; tethers to ground anchors or lower-altitude drones stabilize the tube.  
- **Segments**: Each tube section spans between stations; sections are connected with flexible joints to accommodate movement and thermal expansion.  

## Stations  

- **Stratospheric platforms**: Buoyant, tethered platforms with docking bays, passenger amenities and maintenance facilities.  
- **Launch and recovery**: Linear synchronous motors accelerate pods to cruise speed; electromagnetic brakes and eddy-current systems decelerate arriving pods.  
- **Ground access**: Elevators or tilt‑rotor aircraft provide vertical transport from stations to city centers.  

## Pods  

- **Design**: Needle-shaped carbon-composite darts carrying 2–4 passengers, with small reaction control thrusters and pressure equalization ducts.  
- **Classes**: Commuter (Mach 2), Intercontinental (Mach 4) and Flagship (Mach 6) variants.  
- **Safety**: Each pod includes emergency parachutes or parafoils for controlled descent if necessary.  

Further documents will explore unit economics and deployment roadmap.
