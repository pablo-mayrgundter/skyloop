# R&D Initiation Plan  

This document outlines the initial research programme for Skyloop, focusing on two tabletop-scale prototypes to study near-vacuum transport physics. The first experiment is a linear tube to explore drag, stability and centering at modest speeds and partial vacuum. The second experiment is a circular low vacuum ring to study continuous operation, merging, and boost timing.  

## 1. Tabletop Scale System  

### Tube  
- Length ~1 m; inner diameter 50–75 mm.  
- Materials: clear acrylic or PVC for easy observation.  
- End caps sealed with O‑rings and ports for vacuum pumps and sensors.  
- Achievable pressure: 30–50 mbar with single-stage pumps; 1‑10 mbar with two-stage pumps.  

### Propulsion  
- Coilgun or solenoid-based linear accelerator to launch the dart.  
- Target velocities: 10‑30 m/s, producing moderate g‑loads.  
- Deceleration: foam or electromagnetic braking at the far end.  

### Pod  
- Lightweight dart made from balsa, cardstock, or 3D printed plastic.  
- Needle-like profile with ogive nose; mass ~5‑15 g.  
- Optional instrumentation: small IMU or LED for tracking.  

### Measurements  
- Use optical gates or high-speed cameras to measure velocity decay at different pressures.  
- Observe stability and wall interactions; test magnetic centering.  
- Vary nose shape and fin geometry to compare performance.  

## 2. Circular Low Vacuum Continuous Testbed  

To complement the linear system, build a circular test rig to study continuous low speed operation, on/off ramps, and boost timing.  

### Ring Geometry  
- Circular tube 1‑2 m in diameter; circumference 3‑6 m; inner diameter 10–20 cm.  
- Use clear acrylic or PVC segments to form the ring.  
- Operate at low pressure (200–500 mbar) or with a gentle tailwind inside the ring.  

### Boost Ring  
- Integrate a short segment with small fans or solenoids to accelerate pods.  
- Measure speed and spacing, match velocities between pods.  
- Use the boost ring to enforce timing and spacing.  

### On and Off Ramps  
- Add a tapered insertion tube and splitter exit.  
- Test merge and exit control, speed matching, and safe gap management.  

### Pods  
- Use actual paper airplanes or balsa gliders shaped like needle darts.  
- Test various shapes, center of mass, and stability.  
- Add light instrumentation (LEDs, IMU) for tracking.  

### Experiments  
- Study pod spacing and headway, merging algorithms, and boost timing.  
- Observe stability, drift, and centering in continuous flight.  
- Prototype traffic control software for multi‑pod operations.  

## 3. Scaling Plan  

After validating the 1 m experiment and the circular ring, incrementally scale up:  
- 3–5 m horizontal system with multiple coil stages.  
- 10+ m inclined system to test vertical entry and gravity effects.  
- 50‑100 m outdoor tube with weatherproofing, solar power, and improved vacuum.  
- Eventually a 1 km demonstrator and beyond.  

## 4. Goals  

- Validate theoretical drag and stability models in near-vacuum.  
- Demonstrate magnetic centering and non-contact propulsion at small scale.  
- Gather empirical data to inform design of larger prototypes.  
- Explore traffic management, merging, and continuous operation algorithms in a controlled environment.
