# Skyloop Overview  

Skyloop is an ambitious vision for a global stratospheric transport network. The core idea is to suspend lightweight evacuated tubes high in the stratosphere, using buoyant lift cells and tethers. Inside these tubes, tiny hypersonic "dart" pods carry passengers and cargo between major cities at speeds of Mach 4 or faster.  

## Concept  

- **Buoyant tubes**: Ultra-thin composite cylinders with integrated hydrogen/helium lift cells float at 20–30 km altitude. The low outside pressure reduces structural stress and allows the tube interior to be partially evacuated, dramatically reducing drag.  
- **Hypersonic pods**: Needle-shaped pods carrying 2–4 passengers are launched from each station via linear motor. Once at cruise speed they coast in near-vacuum with minimal energy usage. On arrival, regenerative braking recovers most of the energy.  
- **Stratospheric stations**: Modular platforms anchored by tethers serve as nodes every 20–50 km. Each station houses catapult launchers, catchers and passenger facilities and connects to the ground via fast vertical access.  

## Network Design  

The initial long-haul backbone connects the major economic hubs Tokyo–Los Angeles–New York–London, with future spokes to other global cities. The system's modular architecture allows new segments and stations to be added over time.  

## Advantages  

- **Speed**: Mach 4 pods could make Tokyo to London in about four hours, including transfers.  
- **Capacity**: Continuous pod flow could exceed 300,000 passengers per day per corridor, over ten times current aviation throughput.  
- **Cost**: Preliminary modelling suggests operating costs below US$0.015 per passenger-mile, roughly one-tenth of today's air travel.  
- **Sustainability**: With near-zero drag, the energy required per passenger is tiny. Regenerative braking and renewable power make the system extremely low-carbon.  

## Pod Classes  

- **Commuter darts** (Mach 2): ideal for medium-haul routes.  
- **Intercontinental darts** (Mach 4): the main intercity workhorses.  
- **Flagship darts** (Mach 6): future high-speed option for longest routes.  

Future documents will explore the engineering, economics and roadmap of Skyloop in detail.
